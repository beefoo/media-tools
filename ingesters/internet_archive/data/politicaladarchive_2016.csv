Power. Privilege. Some people are born into the club. It's the Rob Portman story. Old money and exclusive schools. Over 30 years ago Portman went to Washington to join a politically-connected lobbying firm, and he's been working for the rich and powerful ever since. A dedicated outsourcer he's been one of the nation's biggest cheerleaders for trade agreements that have cost millions of American jobs, from NAFTA to CAFTA to fast-tracking the TPP, Portman's never met a free trade agreement he didn't like. For years he's been a pushover for China. It was his job to stop China's illegal dumping of steel. He failed. Looked the other way. Did nothing. And Ohio paid the price. Instead Portman rewarded China with permanent Most Favored Nation status. In Congress he voted for a plan that eliminated overtime pay for six million American workers and supported raising the retirement age for Social Security. As Budget Director he proposed cutting Medicare. In the Senate he voted to cut Pell Grants and opposed the automobile rescue, calling it a lousy deal for Ohio. He's done so much to protect the big banks and Wall Street CEOs, one lobbyist said Portman's face belongs on the Mount Rushmore of the financial services industry. And when the Republican leadership said they wouldn't even hold hearings for a Supreme Court nominee, Rob Portman fell in line and did what he was told. Because falling in line is what you do when you've spent your whole life as a member of the club. Rob Portman. The ultimate Washington insider.

The Democrats have the ultimate super PAC. They're called the mainstream media, who every single day. And I'll tell you why. Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee. She admitted she had sent emails to her family saying hey this attack in Benghazi was caused by Al-Qaeda like elements. She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video and yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign. It was the week she got exposed as a liar. You know, America doesn't owe me anything. I have a debt to America I'll never repay. This isn't just the country I was born in. This is the nation that literally changed the history of my family. My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did. We call that the American Dream. Although it's built on a universal dream of a better life, the fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special. But now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away, and we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch. And that's why I'm running for president.

A proven record presents a collection of timeless Christmas classics by the trusted conservative leader Ted Cruz. Favorites such as how Obamacare Stole Christmas and Rudolph the Underemployed Reindeer. All of the other reindeer couldn't afford to hire Rudolph. Act now and you'll get a leader who does exactly what he says he's going to do in this case read festive stories like Frosty, the Speaker of the House, Look! The speaker is melting before Congress and the Lois Lerner masterpiece Auditing Saint Nick. I will audit him here or there. I will audit him anywhere. The whole family will enjoy reading stories like the Grinch Who Lost her Emails. I know just what I'll do she said with a snicker. I'll use my own server and no one will be the wiser. And if you act now will throw in the inspiring new Christmas story soon to be an instant classic, The Senator who Saved Christmas. Oh this one is a good one. If you are not completely satisfied with this collection of Cruz Christmas classics you probably hate Christmas and America. I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message.","2016/01/21 11:47:27 UTC"
